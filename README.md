# svglogo.hw
In this assignment, I used js files to make an svg file that displayed a logo. The terminal prompts the user to choose a 3 letter logo, choose a background shape, and choose the color of the text and color of the background logo. After this, it generates an svg file which shows the logo created by the user once opened in the browser.
